# 📜 Eldritch Notes

**Eldritch Notes** is a cozy, RPG-styled note-taking system designed to turn your writing process into an immersive journey of growth. Inspired by classic fantasy interfaces and "cozy" games, it rewards your productivity with experience points (XP), levels, and skill ranks.

## ✨ Core Features

### 🖋️ The Manuscript System
*   **Automatic Inscriptions**: No more manual tagging. Simply write `#hashtags` anywhere in your note, and the system will automatically extract them as active inscriptions (tags).
*   **Pinned Scrolls**: Keep your most important chronicles at the top of your library with the pinning system.
*   **Live Metrics**: Track your progress with real-time counters for **Glyphs** (characters), **Words**, and the exact time of your last refinement.
*   **Visual Organization**: A clean, distraction-free writing environment with a focused sidebar for managing your manuscripts.

### 🧙‍♂️ Consult the Sage
Harness the power of the ethereal realm. By consulting the Sage (powered by Gemini AI), you receive:
*   **Scryed Summaries**: A lore-accurate summary of your current writing.
*   **Creative Sparks**: Three divine suggestions to expand your thoughts.
*   **Wisdom XP**: Gain 20 XP for every consultation.

### 🎭 Character Growth (The RPG Loop)
Your identity as a Chronicler is fixed, reflecting your steady presence in the library. As you write, you grow:
*   **Leveling System**: Every 1,000 XP advances you to the next Rank.
*   **Skill Points (SP)**: Earn SP upon leveling up to invest in skills like **Focus**, **Lore**, **Creativity**, and **Discipline**.
*   **Inspirational Ranks**: While skill levels are purely cosmetic, they serve as a visual testament to your dedication and creative evolution.

## 📈 Experience (XP) Rewards
Your progress is measured by the ink you spill and the thoughts you organize:

| Action | XP Reward |
| :--- | :--- |
| **New Chronicle** | 50 XP |
| **Written Glyphs** | 0.5 XP per character |
| **Automatic Inscriptions** | 10 XP per unique hashtag found |

## 🎨 Aesthetic & UX

## 🎨 Visual Identity: The Arcane Interface

### 1. The Sign of the Book
Instead of a static portrait, your identity is forged from the **First Letter** of your Chronicle's title. This runic sign evolves as you rename your journey, anchored by your current level—a pure numeric rank of your standing in the Great Library.

### 2. The Aesthetic: "Cozy-Dark Arcane"
*   **Primary Palette**: Void Purple (#a855f7), Ghostly Indigo (#6366f1), and Library Slate (#0f172a).
*   **Typography**: *Cinzel* for ancient headings and *Quicksand* for modern readability.
*   **Atmosphere**: Real-time glow effects, particle-like background textures, and a reactive runic cursor that pulses when hovering over interactive elements.

## ✨ Arcane Features

### 🖋️ The Manuscript System
*   **Automatic Inscriptions**: Harness the power of runes. Simply write `#hashtags` anywhere in your note, and the system automatically extracts and displays them as active inscriptions.
*   **Pinned Scrolls**: Use the pin icon to keep your most vital chronicles at the top of your library for quick access.
*   **Live Metrics**: Monitor your progress with real-time tracking of **Glyphs** (characters), **Words**, and exact **Refinement Timestamps**.

### 💀 The Forgotten Catacombs
Not every thought is meant for the light. 
*   **Burying Scrolls**: Click the skull icon to "Bury" a note, moving it from your active library to the **Forgotten Catacombs**.
*   **Exhuming Wisdom**: Descend into the Catacombs to view your archived thoughts. You can "Exhume" them to return them to the library or **Incinerate** (permanently delete) them if they are no longer needed.
*   **Spectral Navigation**: Switch between the living Library and the spectral Catacombs via the navigation toggle at the bottom of the sidebar.

### 🖱️ Mastery of the Interface
*   **Arcane Context Menu**: Right-click anywhere in the app to access the quick-action menu. From here, you can summon new scrolls, view your stats, consult the Sage, or manage your active manuscript without moving your cursor to the toolbar.
*   **Custom Rune Cursor**: A reactive, magical pointer that pulses and shifts as you interact with the library's elements.

### 🧙‍♂️ Consult the Sage
When the path forward is clouded, scry into the ethereal realm using the Sage (powered by Gemini AI):
*   **Lore Summaries**: Get a thematic summary of your current writing.
*   **Creative Sparks**: Receive three divine suggestions to expand your narrative or thoughts.
*   **Wisdom XP**: Earn 20 XP for every consultation.

### 🎭 RPG Progression
Your identity as a "Traveling Scribe" is fixed, reflecting your permanent role in this library.
*   **Leveling**: Every 1,000 XP advances your Scribe Rank.
*   **Skill Points (SP)**: Earn SP upon leveling up to invest in **Focus**, **Lore**, **Creativity**, and **Discipline**.
*   **Growth Visualization**: Your level and rank are prominently displayed on your avatar and within the Character Sheet.
